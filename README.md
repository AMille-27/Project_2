# Project_2
## Brief description of the app and its purpose.
This app uses TheMealDB API. This will be used to search through meals and recipe ideas. Users will be able to search using dietary preferences such as vegan and vegetarian. 
## A list of packages needed to run the app.
Users will need the following packages:
Tidyverse
JSONlite
Purrr
Shiny
## A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to running your app).
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "jsonlite","purrr", "shiny")) 
## The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.
